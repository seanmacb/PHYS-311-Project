# PHYS-311-Project
 A project that involved video analysis of the motion of a pendulum in order to approximate the parameters (described by classical mechanics) that define the motion.

Video stored in "IMG_0343.MOV"
"FinalWriteup.pdf" contains the final writeup detailing the processes and analysis that derived the physical parameters of the pendulum.
"ClassicalProj2Sean+Mo.csv" contains the analyzed positions of the pendulum using LabPro software
"graphprogram.py" contains the program used to extract the data obtained by the pendulum video
"finalsimgraphs.py" contains the final comparison graphs used by Mo Hayat and I to compare predicted values to the observed values
